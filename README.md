# 42Cursus

My 42 cursus directory, each project with their subject

This repo is just the collection of references to the projects, plus the library of functions I update and use in my projects, each project is a repository in itself
<!-- as well as a reference to a tester -->

| *__Project__* | *__Overview__* | *__Attempts__* | *__Grade__* |
| :-----------: | :------------: | :------------: | :---------: |
| libft         |  This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus. | 2 |[![anvannin's 42 Libft Score](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/cleh36s9k00060fmefi6qv520/project/2817323)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)|
| Born2beroot   | This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization. | 1 |[![anvannin's 42 Born2beroot Score](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/cleh36s9k00060fmefi6qv520/project/2840487)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)|
| get_next_line | May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, you will always need a way to read content line by line. It is time to start working on this function, which will be essential for your future projects. | 1 |[![anvannin's 42 get_next_line Score](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/cleh36s9k00060fmefi6qv520/project/2840485)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)|
| ft_printf     | This project is pretty straightforward, you have to recode printf. You will learn what is and how to implement variadic functions. Once you validate it, you will reuse this function in your future projects. | 2 |[![anvannin's 42 ft_printf Score](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/cleh36s9k00060fmefi6qv520/project/2840483)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)|
| push_swap     |This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, you will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting. | 3 |[![anvannin's 42 push_swap Score](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/cleh36s9k00060fmefi6qv520/project/2876716)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)|
| minitalk      | The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus. | 1 |[![anvannin's 42 minitalk Score](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/cleh36s9k00060fmefi6qv520/project/2960200)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)|
| fract-ol      | Discover 2D programming and the psychedelic universe of fractals in this project, using minilibX. | 1 |[![anvannin's 42 fract-ol Score](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/cleh36s9k00060fmefi6qv520/project/2973364)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)|
| minishell     | The objective of this project is for you to create a simple shell. | 1 |[![anvannin's 42 minishell Score](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/cleh36s9k00060fmefi6qv520/project/3036838)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)|
| philosopers   | Eat, Sleep, Spaghetti, repeat. This project is about learning how threads work by precisely timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from hunger. | 1 |[![anvannin's 42 Philosophers Score](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/cleh36s9k00060fmefi6qv520/project/3036876)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)|
